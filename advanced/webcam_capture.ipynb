    "## Capturing an image from a webcam\n",
    "\n",
    "In your course, you might want to have students use their own webcam. As an example, if you are teaching object detection methods, it may be nice if students can experiment with this on frames that they captured themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, all of the python code in a Jupyter Notebook is executed on the so-called 'server side'. I.e. that means it runs on one of the servers from SURF. That is convenient for many things (for example it allows all your students to use exactly the same software environment), but it is a challenge if you want to use local resources such as a webcam.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way in which this can be achieved is by executing Javascript code. Javascript code can be executed on the 'client side', in the browser. That is: it is executed by the browser on the laptop or deskop of the student/teacher. There is one downside to this: browsers may differ, and Javascript code might not work equally well in all browsers. The following code has been tested on Google Chrome, version 107.0.5304.107."
